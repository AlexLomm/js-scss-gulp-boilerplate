# Instructions

The app will be served on `localhost:3000` in "watch" mode, which includes:

2. Live browser refresh, if the JS files are changed.

Alternatively, `npm run build` can be run to prepare the files for production use, which includes:

1. Transpilation and minification of SCSS files
2. Transpilation, uglification and minification of JS files
